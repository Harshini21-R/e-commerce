TechStore — Frontend-only e-commerce demo (Dark tech style)

Files:
- index.html, shop.html, cart.html, admin.html
- style.css (dark tech theme)
- script.js (all logic: products, cart, admin) - uses localStorage

How to run:
1. Extract the ZIP to a folder on your Desktop.
2. Open the folder in VS Code (or terminal).
3. Run a local static server inside that folder:
   - Using Python: python -m http.server
   - Or using Node: npx live-server
4. Open http://localhost:8000 (or port shown) and the site will load.
5. Admin page: add products (stored in browser localStorage). Add-to-cart works and cart persists in localStorage.
